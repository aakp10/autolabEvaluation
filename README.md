# autolabEvaluation Module
 The module has been created to incorporate and use it in the autolabJS ,therefore two implementations are made for the same :  
* an exportableModule has been made which can be _imported_ and used to do the evaluation  
This is present in the Exportable module branch
* To temporarily see how the module functions  before incorporating in autolab  
	a *cli* version has been made

## CLI version

	* use node app.js *id_no_of_Submitter*
	* to check the changes have been made in the table view the table_evaluation table
*	Database model used is:  
	* database name : details
